# Rock Paper Scissor
<br>
Creating a Rock Paper Scissors game app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a fun project. Begin with HTML for the structure, defining buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors. Use CSS for styling, making it visually appealing with colors and animations. In JavaScript, write logic to handle user clicks, generate a random choice for the computer, compare selections, and determine the winner. Display results dynamically on the page. Implement reset functionality to play again. Ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes. Finally, add sound effects for an immersive experience. With these elements combined, you'll have an engaging Rock Paper Scissors game app!
